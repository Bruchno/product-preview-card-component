## 🚀 What I learned

While building this component, I practiced:

- Structuring semantic HTML for a compact layout
- Styling elements with consistent spacing and color variables
- Adapting the layout for different screen sizes using media queries
- Refining visual details like typography and hover states

This challenge helped me improve the balance between flexibility and design fidelity — especially when switching between desktop and mobile views.

## 🔧 Areas for future development

I'd like to:

- Explore how to modularize the component for reuse
- Integrate this style into larger product layout templates
- Experiment with animation for hover states or transitions
